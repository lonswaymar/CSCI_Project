            <h2>
                Brief History
            </h2>
            <p>
                Car culture has been a dominant political, cultural, and economic part of the United States since it's major introduction into society succeeding Gerald Ford's implementation of the assemply line and mass production of the model T.
                As cars became more affordable to the average citizen, dependence on cars followed proportionally demanding more and more space for such vehicles in urban planning and infrastructure.
                <!-- To account for this pedestrians slowly lost rights on the streets of the cities they had originally owned. -->
                Demonstrated in the image to the right, it's evident that even by 1925, futurists anticipated substantial increases in space dedicated solely to cars, roads, and their storage. 
                However, the optimism of such futurists failed to account for the costs of saving space for pedestrians to attain such goals.
                In practice, people like Robert Moses often <a href = "./Resources.html#moses_eminent">greatly expanded infrastructure for the sake of cars </a> and an ever expanding suburbia that grew further from cities directly resulting in pedestrians losing the walkways they originally owned. 
                These events often greatly displaced American citizens all over the country, often disproportionately towards people of color and immigrants (<a href = ./Resources.html#moses_disproportionate>like in the case of the Lincoln Center</a>).
                Combining this with technological advancements and ever expanding rights for the automobile, people have slowly become more and more endangered by vehicular transportation.
                As we look to today's America, we can look to see the impacts of such dangers on the average person.
                Ease of access, dependency on cars, improper judgement, irresponsible action, and careless driving have all added to an unnecessary increase in fatality and injury risk.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Project Goals and General Questions
            </h2>
            <p class = "us_prevalence">
                Prior to finding the causes and effects of risk and injury resulting from a dependence on cars, we must first establish the existence of car culture in the U.S.
                As such, we aim to answer three main questions surrounding American travel:
                Are cities in the U.S. less walkable than her foreign counterparts?
                Are cars more attainable in the United States?
                Does income/location impact either the quality or quantity of cars owned in the US?
                The answers to such questions aim to act as a proxy to quantify a culture of car ownership and dependency in America.
                Providing context around American life, and vehicular use in particular, can help to outline what dangers are likely to be present and how it may impact the average citizen.
            </p>

            <p>
                The costs of car dependence are both individual and collective. 
                Individually, the average American pays over $500 for a used car (this excludes gas, insurance, maintenance, and repairs). 
                Meanwhile, the average American salary is just under $60000; yearly, used-car ownership in America thus costs over 20% of the average individuals’ earnings.  
                Consumers should expect large purchases to appreciate: not so for automobiles. 
                Car purchasers expect most vehicles to lose up to 20% of their sticker price within the first year of ownership.  
                Beyond financial burden, the cost of car dependence is bodily too: according to the National Safety Council, the odds of dying by a motor-vehicle crash is 1 in 93, more than twice the likelihood of dying by firearm assault. 
                While the preceding dangers of car dependence affect the individual, we can also examine its effects on a broader scale.

            </p>

            <p>
                The costs of car dependence manifest broadly in American society. 
                The prioritization of car traffic above the pedestrian in the American urban planning ethos has itself a myriad of baneful consequences to Americans. 
                Firstly, communities of underrepresented demographics tend to be the groups of people most likely to be displaced by road construction or living next to the high traffic areas. 
                Less pointedly, the walkability scores in US cities are much lower than their peers of similar size in other developed countries. 
                The consequences are poorer quality of life, worse air conditions, and higher likelihood of pedestrian harm in motor-vehicle accidents. 
                Moreover, the transportation sector is responsible for the largest portion of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. 
                Although there is a push towards electrification, the mining of the minerals required to power EVs and the gigantification of personal vehicles nullifies their proposed benefits.

            </p>
            We aim to explore which of these dangers harm the individual and society the most. 
            We propose to research which driving habits yield the highest fatality rates and which types of vehicles safeguard the passenger’s safety. 
            We will also explore which communities have been most adversely affected by road construction and development, and look to correlate the relationship between proximity to traffic and respiratory disease.
