                Brief History
            </h2>
            <p class = "history_1">
                Car culture has been a dominant political, cultural, and economic part of the United States since it's major introduction into society succeeding Gerald Ford's implementation of the assemply line and mass production of the model T.
                As cars became more affordable to the average citizen, dependence on cars followed proportionally demanding more and more space for such vehicles in urban planning and infrastructure.
                <!-- To account for this pedestrians slowly lost rights on the streets of the cities they had originally owned. -->
                Demonstrated in the image to the right, it's evident that even by 1925, futurists anticipated substantial increases in space dedicated solely to cars, roads, and their storage. 
                However, the optimism of such futurists failed to account for the costs of saving space for pedestrians to attain such goals.
                In practice, people like Robert Moses often <a href = "./Resources.html#moses_eminent">greatly expanded infrastructure for the sake of cars </a> and an ever expanding suburbia that grew further from cities directly resulting in pedestrians losing the walkways they originally owned. 
                These events often greatly displaced American citizens all over the country, often disproportionately towards people of color and immigrants (<a href = ./Resources.html#moses_disproportionate>like in the case of the Lincoln Center</a>).
                Combining this with technological advancements and ever expanding rights for the automobile, people have slowly become more and more endangered by vehicular transportation.
                As we look to today's America, we can look to see the impacts of such dangers on the average person.
                Ease of access, dependency on cars, improper judgement, irresponsible action, and careless driving have all added to an unnecessary increase in fatality and injury risk.

            <h2>
                Project Goals and General Questions
            </h2>

            <p class = "us_prevalence">
                Prior to finding the causes and effects of risk and injury resulting from a dependence on cars, we must first establish the existence of car culture in the U.S.
                As such, we aim to answer three main questions surrounding American travel:
                Are cities in the U.S. less walkable than her foreign counterparts?
                Are cars more attainable in the United States?
                Does income/location impact either the quality or quantity of cars owned in the US?
                The answers to such questions aim to act as a proxy to quantify a culture of car ownership and dependency in America.
                Providing context around American life, and vehicular use in particular, can help to outline what dangers are likely to be present and how it may impact the average citizen.
                We aim split these into two types of manifestations of impact: financial and physical.
                Through the two, a holistic approach to the main question reveals itself such that we can identify and suggest potential solutions to strengthen broader society and reduce the risks and dangers that have developed over the past 116 years.

                The costs of car dependence are both individual and collective. Individually, the average American pays over $500 for a used car (this excludes gas, insurance, maintenance, and repairs). Meanwhile, the average American salary is just under <a href = "./Resources.html">$60000</a>; yearly, used-car ownership in America thus costs over <a href = "./Resources.html"> 20% </a> of the average individuals’ earnings.  Consumers should expect large purchases to appreciate - not so for automobiles. Car purchasers such expect most vehicles to lose up to 20% of their sticker price within the first year of ownership. In addition to their expense to own the costs of losing one’s car could be a lay off or forced-restructuring of one’s schedule. In getting their car fixed or purchasing a new one, the cycle continues.  Beyond financial burden, the cost of car dependence is bodily too. According to the National Safety Council, the odds of dying by a motor-vehicle crash is <a href = "./Resources.html">1 in 93</a>, more than twice the likelihood of dying by firearm assault. While further down on the list, pedestrian fatalities are still of the most common causes of death at 1 in 485, surpassing motorcycle accidents, drowning, fires, and choking. While the preceding dangers of car dependence affect the individual, we can also examine its affects on a broader scale.
            </p>

            <p>
                The costs of car dependence manifest broadly in American society. The prioritization of car traffic above the pedestrian in the American urban planning ethos has itself a myriad of baneful consequences. Firstly, communities of underrepresented demographics tend to be the people most likely to be displaced by road construction or living next to the high traffic areas. Less pointedly, the walkability scores in US cities are much lower than their peers of similar size in other developed countries. The rise of the automobile has driven the wealthy and middle class to suburbs and kept lower income communities in tighter, denser urban spaces. Some of the consequences are segregation, poor quality of life, suffering air conditions, and the proliferation of the car-dependent suburb (neighborhoods that are largely unnavigable without a personal vehicle). Moreover, the transportation sector is responsible for the <a href = "./Resources.html"> largest portion of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.</a> Although there is a push towards electrification, the mining of the minerals required to power EVs and the gigantification of personal vehicles nullifies their proposed benefits. Having looked at the societal impacts of car culture in the US, we aim to understand and quantify the worst offenders and subsequently provide advice to individual car owners and regulatory advice to city planners.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We aim to explore which of the costs and dangers harm the individual and society the most. We propose to research which driving habits yield the highest fatality rates and which types of vehicles safeguard the passenger’s safety. Regarding behavior, we’d like to see which habits yield the worst accidents: for example, is driving drunk significantly worse than driving distracted? We can also ask questions about newer safety features: do cars with X feature have a lower fatality rate than those that do not? Some other metrics we plan to evaluate include the fatality likelihood of a crash based on travel speed or weight of vehicle. In addition, we would like to investigate whether the safest vehicles are as easy to own and maintain as more dangerous ones. In the next section, we look to understand how car culture affects society on a broader scale by looking into the development history of the US interstate system and understanding what other qualities of life have changed as the proportion of highways and car ownership has increased. Lastly, we will look for solutions and provide recommendations to both car purchasers, so that individuals can choose the vehicles that will prioritize their safety and financial security, and city planners and regulators so we can provide suggestions on how to increase safety, lower emissions, and create more cohesive pedestrian-friendly spaces.
